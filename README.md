## How to Download and Use

## Security and Virus Scan

Trust and transparency are critical when downloading an executable file. For this reason, every release of this software is automatically scanned for malware.

### How It Works

1.  A **GitHub Action** automatically builds the `PDF_Merger.exe` file in a clean, secure cloud environment.
2.  This same action immediately submits the newly created `.exe` file to **VirusTotal**.
3.  VirusTotal scans the file with **over 70 different antivirus engines** from major security companies.
4.  The workflow then creates a new GitHub Release and **posts the public link to the VirusTotal scan results directly in the release description.**

### How to Verify a Download

Before you download any file, you can see the security report for yourself:

1.  Navigate to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/graylagx2/Free-PDF-File-Merger/releases).
2.  Find the release you wish to download.
3.  In the release notes, look for the **VirusTotal Security Report** section.
4.  Click the **[View Scan Results]** link to see the full, public report on VirusTotal's website.

This process ensures that the file you are downloading has been verified as safe by a wide range of security scanners.
